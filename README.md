# Linear_Algebra_Course_Projects
Here is the explanation about three projects of Linear Algebra course:
* LU decomposition
* Denoising signals using least-square 
* SVD decomposition

## LU decomposition
The solution of Ax=b is done by the line reduction method in O(n^3). But if we have the LU decomposition of the matrix, the solution of the equation can be done in X time. We also know that the calculation of the matrices X and X itself takes place in time X. As a result, solving a device by calculating the LU decomposition of its matrix and finding the solution of the device from it is not a cost-effective method.
